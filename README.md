# Classification
make lists go into categories

## Day 5 Homework

Categorize stuff! Separate flicks into genres, or separate movies from TV shows! Make a whole new thing with categories, like messages separated into channels! Use your tremendous creativity! Exclamation point!

Or heck, just make separate lists based on the second input field you added in the weekend homework!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Add a search field, and only show the results that match the search criteria. Here are some things you may wish to use while implementing search:

* [`Array.prototype.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find?v=control) (very similar to `findIndex()`)
* [`HTMLElement.dataset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset) (remember those IDs we stored?)
* [`display: none`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp) (Heck, you could add a class that includes this rule, and add and move that class from elements you wish to hide.)
